### Code
This project as a whole is distributed under **AGPL-3.0-or-later**.

Some individual files may be available under more permissive or **dual licensing** options through
REUSE-compatible SPDX headers or adjacent `.license` files. The nearest file-level license notice is
the source of truth for that file; keep existing license, copyright, and provenance notices intact.

New original Erida files should be licensed under **MIT** and should carry REUSE/SPDX metadata near
the top of the file:

```text
SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 <copyright holder>
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

`MIT OR AGPL-3.0-or-later` is also acceptable when an explicit dual-license is useful. Use MIT or
dual MIT/AGPL licensing only for code that is original to Erida or based on sources that permit this.
Do not mark copied or adapted AGPL/GPL/fork code as MIT-only; preserve the original license and
attribution. Existing AGPL files and files ported from AGPL projects are expected to remain AGPL.
When MIT or dual-licensed files are built into Erida, the combined project distribution still follows
**AGPL-3.0-or-later**.

Pull requests are checked for this metadata on new text files. Existing files without SPDX metadata
are left alone. Existing files that already contain SPDX metadata may produce non-blocking review
warnings if copyright metadata looks incomplete.

Full license texts can be found in `LICENSE-AGPLv3.TXT`, `LICENSE-GPLv3.TXT`, and `LICENSE-MIT.TXT`.

### Assets
Most media assets are licensed under **CC-BY-SA 3.0**, unless stated otherwise.

### Commercial use

<summary> Attribution</summary>

We organize borrowed content from other forks into dedicated subdirectories.

This helps preserve proper attribution and reduces merge conflicts.

Content inside these subdirectories originates from their respective forks and may include modifications.
Changes are marked with comments around the edited lines.
